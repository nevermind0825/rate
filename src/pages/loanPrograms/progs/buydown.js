                        The 2-1 Buydown program is simple: one of our partners contributes an upfront fee, which lowers your interest rate by up to two percentage points for the first two years of your loan. This knocks down initial monthly payments, so you can allocate funds toward transforming a new house into a dream home, and enables you to build equity as you ease into your new home.
